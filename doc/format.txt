Track list file format
======================

Subset of markdown, consisting of only:
- #-style headers
- list items

Headers are ignored. The list items must be a music link followed by a list of likes/dislikes. For example:

    - [Melodic Techno set 1 (N'to, worakls, solee...) - Ella](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgsWM2_UebE): Eelis -Gielbier Daan
    - [Liftboy - Sheeks](tracks/Liftboi - Scheeks.mp3): Eelis

The first line indicates that Daan and Eelis like the track but Gielbier doesn't.
The second line links to a file stored in a subdir in the same collaboratively edited repository. This can be used for tracks for which we don't have a url (obviously this should be used sparingly so as not to explode the repository size, since git is not for bulk file storage).

Lines with nonpositive score are discarded. Score is defined as:

    likes - dislikes * 2

This way, it takes at least 3 likes to override a dislike.

The playlist for a tracklist is generated by replicating each entry N times,
where N is the score of the entry (so that an entry with 2 likes is doubled),
and then repeatedly taking random elements from it.
